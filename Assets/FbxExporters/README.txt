Installing Unity Integration for Maya
-------------------------------------

The easiest way to install the Unity integration For Maya is from the FbxExports Settings panel in Unity.

        MenuBar -> Edit -> Project Settings -> Fbx Export -> Install Unity Integration

This menu item locates and uses the most recent version of Maya installed. If you want 
to specify a custom version or location you can browse and locate your version.

Alternately, you can install the package and integrations from the command-line
using a script, an example of which can be found in the scripts folder of the 
Maya integration. The version for OSX is called install_maya_plugin.sh.
